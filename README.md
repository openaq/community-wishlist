# Community Wishlist
We'd love to hear from you! What would you like to see added to the platform? Have an exciting air quality project idea? Share it with the community by [creating an issue](https://github.com/openaq/project-ideas/issues/new).

## What sorts of ideas are we looking for?
- Tools you would find useful
- Projects that build on top of the platform
- Visualizations or apps that use the data
- Anything else you can think of!

## Do I need to work on an idea I proposed?
Nope, that's the beauty of a _wishlist_. It's a place to collect ideas, spark interesting converesation and connect people in the community who can help make it a reality. It also helps us better understand community needs to prioritize our efforts.

Be sure to check out [existing ideas](https://github.com/openaq/project-ideas/issues) and comment on/upvote the ones you like. If something excites you and you would like to lead the effort to make it happen, let us know.
